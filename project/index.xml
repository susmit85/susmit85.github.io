      <description>IPoC is a general purpose tunnel-ing protocol that enables all IP applications to utilize Information Centric Networks. We implement the IPoC protocol using Named Data Networking (NDN) semantics and using mobile communication as the driving example, show how NDN and IPoC can bring ICN benefits to 5G mobile networks by simplifying the mobility plane, introducing intelligent functionality, and reducing network complexity.

      <description>Named Data Networking(NDN) is a Future Internet Architecture where data in the network is accessed directly by its name rather than through the host where it resides. Naming the data allows the network to participate in operations that were not feasible before. Specifically, the network can participate in discovering and local caching of the data, merging similar requests, intelligent retrieval and more. I have been contributing to NDN codebase and applications as part of a multi-university team.</description>

      <description>Many scientific domains, such as climate science and High Energy Physics (HEP), have data management requirements that are not well supported by the IP network architecture. Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new network architecture whose service model is better aligned with the needs of data-oriented applications.
NDN-SCI is the first scientific data management application designed and implemented on top of NDN. We use this application to manage climate and HEP data over a dedicated, high-performance testbed.</description>

      <description>This is a 8 node testbed that helps us better understand the challenges in large data applications and deploy cutting-edge protocols. It reaches locations such as Atmospheric and Computer Science Departments at Colorado State University, LBNL, NWCS, and CalTech.
The testbed is connected via 10G links with machines that have 40 cores each, 128GB RAM and 48TB disk space. The testbed is also able to deploy on-demand end-to-end paths using OSCARS.</description>

      <description>Advancing discovery in many scientific fields depends crucially on our ability to extract the wealth of knowledge buried in massive datasets whose scale and complexity continue to grow exponentially with time. In order to address this fundamental challenge, this project aims to develop and deploy SANDIE, a Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture supported by advanced Software Defined Network services for Data Intensive Science, with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) high energy physics program as the leading use case.</description>
