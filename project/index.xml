      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://named-data.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Named Data Networking(NDN)&lt;/a&gt; is a Future Internet Architecture where data in the network is accessed directly by its name rather than through the host where it resides. Naming the data allows the network to participate in operations that were not feasible before. Specifically, the network can participate in discovering and local caching of the data, merging similar requests, intelligent retrieval and more. I have been contributing to NDN codebase and applications as part of a multi-university team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many scientific domains, such as climate science and High Energy Physics (HEP), have data management requirements that are not well supported by the IP network architecture. Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new network architecture whose service model is better aligned with the needs of data-oriented applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/named-data/ndn-atmos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NDN-SCI&lt;/a&gt; is the first scientific data management application designed and implemented on top of NDN. We use this application to manage climate and HEP data over a dedicated, high-performance testbed.  NDN-SCI utilizes NDN primitives to implement common data management operations such as publishing, search, efficient
retrieval, and publication access control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NDN-Science Testbed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a NSF grant, we created a 8 node testbed that helps us better understand the challenges in large data applications. It reaches locations such as Atmospheric and Computer Science Departments at Colorado State University, LBNL, NWCS, and CalTech. The testbed was deployed with the support of ESnet. Connectivity is via 10G links with high-end machines that with 40 cores each, 128GB RAM and 48TB disk space. The testbed is also able to deploy on-demand end-to-end paths using OSCARS. The machines cumulatively host over 50TB of climate data and 10 TB Physics data that are used for research, experimentation and development of climate applications. The machines are run latest version of Fedora and have the latest NDN software installed. We are looking forward to adding several sites to the testbed, both inside and outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;
